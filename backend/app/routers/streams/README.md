# Streams Router Modules

This directory contains the refactored live streams router functionality, split into focused modules for better maintainability and performance.

## Module Structure

- `__init__.py` - Package initialization
- `router.py` - Main router that includes all sub-routers
- `ingestion.py` - Bet ingestion endpoints (`/live/ingest`)
- `management.py` - Stream CRUD operations (`/live/streams`)
- `analytics.py` - Analytics and metrics endpoints (`/live/streams/{stream_id}/metrics`)
- `bookmarks.py` - Bookmark functionality (`/live/streams/{stream_id}/bookmarks`)
- `snapshots.py` - Snapshot functionality (`/live/streams/{stream_id}/snapshots`)
- `hits.py` - Hit analysis endpoints (`/live/streams/{stream_id}/hits`)

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand and modify.
2. **Better Performance**: Reduced coupling between unrelated functionalities.
3. **Enhanced Security**: More focused exception handling and input validation.
4. **Easier Testing**: Each module can be tested independently.
5. **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code.

## Migration Notes

The refactored code maintains full API compatibility with the previous monolithic implementation. All endpoints and request/response schemas remain unchanged.
